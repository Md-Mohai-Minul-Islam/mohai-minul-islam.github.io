<p><br><br>My name is Aryan Mittal, and I am a first-year undergraduate at the 
Georgia Institute of Technology, studying Mathematics and Computer Science. 
I maintain a list of my publications and ongoing research projects under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, 
and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. 
You may also check out my <a href="">Github profile</a>. Ideas and contributions are always welcome!<br><br>

For a brief summary of my professional work so far, you can take a look at my <a href="/resume">resume</a>. 
Here's a little bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>
