<h2><a href="https://www.gtspaceprogram.com/">Yellow Jacket Space Program</a></h2>

As a member of the YJSP Flight Dynamics Team, I aid development towards achieving YJSP's goal of becoming the first collegiate team to launch a liquid-fueled rocket to the Kármán Line (the edge of space). Currently, I am expanding the rocket trajectory simulator capabilities to model a black box's deployment and descent under parachute.
