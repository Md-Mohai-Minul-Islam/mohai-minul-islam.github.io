</dl>

<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Aryan, a first-year Mathematics and Computer Science student at Georgia Tech.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in the fields of combinatorics, game theory, data science, and their real-world applications in areas such as sports analytics and operations research. In my free time, I am an avid Atlanta sports fan. When Iâ€™m not busy cheering on my Braves or Falcons, you can probably find me watching a sci-fi movie, <a href="/booklist/">reading</a>, or (re)watching <em>Seinfeld</em>.</p>
