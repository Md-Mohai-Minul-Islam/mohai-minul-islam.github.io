Hi! I'm Aryan, a first-year Mathematics and Computer Science student at Georgia Tech.

I'm interested in the fields of combinatorics, game theory, data science, and their real-world applications in areas such as sports analytics and operations research. 

In my free time, I am an avid Atlanta sports fan. When I'm not busy cheering on my Braves or Falcons, you can probably find me watching a sci-fi movie, <a href="/miscellaneous/reading/">reading</a>, or (re)watching *Seinfeld*.

<p><br><br>My name is Aryan Mittal, and I am a first-year undergraduate at the

I maintain a list of my publications and ongoing research projects under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, 
and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. 
You may also check out my <a href="">Github profile</a>. Ideas and contributions are always welcome!<br><br>
